                                            some level of stress after their parents' separation or dissolution, there's

                                            family could survive. It's no wonder that kids experience distress;
                                            after all these major changes have taken place with one parent going ï»¿to an

                                            while others never really go "back" normal after their parents' separation

                                            The addition of a step-parent and possibly several siblings can be another
                                            big adjustment for children. And often both parents remarry,
                                            which means more changes to their lives--and this all happens before they
                                            even get into school!<br>

                                            parental separation, which takes place at such a tender time in one's life -
                                            before they become
                                            responsible individuals who must make decisions about how much involvement
                                            is enough concern for themselves rather than relying on others all day long
                                            like a parent(s) would do best.

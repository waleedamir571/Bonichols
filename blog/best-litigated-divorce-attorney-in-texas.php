                                            significant relationship, which can evoke feelings of grief similar to those
                                            experienced after a death. However, unlike the finality of death, divorce
                                            often involves ongoing interactions with an ex-spouse, particularly if
                                            children are involved. This ongoing connection can make it challenging to
                                            move on emotionally.

                                            often a shared future. The grieving process can be intense, with feelings of
                                            sadness, loneliness, and emptiness. This grief is compounded by the
                                            practical changes that accompany divorce, such as moving to a new home,
                                            changes in financial status, and adjusting to single parenthood.

                                            Litigation is inherently adversarial. Each party is represented by a divorce

                                            can make communicating effectively with your ex-spouse difficult and can
                                            exacerbate negative emotions.

                                            In litigation, much of the decision-making power is in the hands of the

                                            control over your own life. Decisions about your future, finances, and

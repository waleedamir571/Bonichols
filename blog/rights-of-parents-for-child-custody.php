                                        <div class="text">Courts often prefer joint physical custody to ensure that
                                            children have access to their parents, and this is sometimes the default
                                            state decision. A disputing parent might need to prove that the children
                                            should not spend any time with either parent. For more information, visit

                                            Parents who share physical custody must spend time together with their
                                            children. It does not need to be 50-50. If parents cannot reach an
                                            agreement, courts may order a schedule, and parents can agree on alternate
                                            weeks, months, and holidays.

                                            Parents can be involved in the lives and decisions of their children through
                                            joint physical custody. Research shows that children are more likely to
                                            receive joint custody when their parents’ divorce in low-conflict divorces.
                                            This allows them to participate in the lives and decisions of their
                                            children. Joint physical custody is not a good option if parents’ conflict.
                                            However, it can lead to emotional conflict between them.

                                            However, this arrangement is not equal to joint physical custody. Visitation

                                    <h3>Visitation Rights of the Parent Non-Custodial</h3>
                                    <div class="my-texttt">
                                        <div class="text">In sole physical custody arrangements, the visitation schedule
                                            must be agreed to by both custodial or noncustodial parent. These situations
                                            are usually when the custodial parent fears that the child might be hurt
                                            (such abuse or neglect) or the children don't want to visit the noncustodial
                                            parent. If there are continuing violations, a judge could make the violator
                                            guilty by contempt of court. In some states, interfering with visitation
                                            could be a crime. If you suspect you have violated your visitation rights,
                                            you should immediately consult an attorney.

                                    <h3>Visitation rights to Grandparents, Stepparents and Caretakers</h3>
                                    <div class="my-texttt">
                                        <div class="text">Each state has its own laws that allow grandparents,
                                            stepparents and foster parents to have close relationships with children.
                                            However, laws in each state are different and some are more restrictive than
                                            others.
                                            <br>
                                            Many states have visitor laws that permit grandparents to have visitation
                                            rights. This is best for the child's interests. Some states, however, limit
                                            grandparents' visitation rights to court-ordered visits under certain
                                            conditions.

                                            Step-parents and grandparents need to be aware that visitation is a
                                            state-specific matter and that courts have made contradictory rulings. If
                                            you are unable to accept visitation, it is a good idea to consult an
                                            attorney.

                                    <div class="my-texttt">
                                        <div class="text">Legal custody allows you to make decisions about your child's
                                            education. This includes financial support, education, religious
                                            instruction, medical treatment, and financial care. Legal custody is similar
                                            to physical custody. It can be shared equally by both parents or vested
                                            solely by one parent.
                                            <br>
                                            Most states have both spouses maintaining joint legal custody. This means
                                            that both parents are able to make decisions about child-rearing. In very
                                            rare cases, sole legal custody might be granted by the courts. A parent who
                                            has sole legal custody is allowed to unilaterally decide about the child's
                                            care.

                                        <div class="text">In some cases, close relatives or friends may seek custody.
                                            This type of custody is called "nonparental custody", "third party custody"
                                            or "guardianship" by the states. 11 A petition is filed with court. The
                                            court will pay the fees and sometimes, the parents will file a letter of
                                            consent. The court conducts background investigations and arranges
                                            interviews and home inspections. The judge will then decide about the best
                                            interests for the child.

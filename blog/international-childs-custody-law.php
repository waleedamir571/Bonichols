                                                     In cases where parents do not live in the same country, it can be difficult to determine which country has jurisdiction over custody arrangements. This is because a court's choice of the 
                                                     forum must consider various factors, including where Child spends their time during disputes and how many contacts they had with each parent before arriving.

                                                     When a parent files for child custody in one country, the other side may argue that it is not their responsibility. In those cases, you'll need to take action and go through
                                                     with an original court case if necessary.

                                                <div class="text">If your child has been taken to another country without permission, a treaty known as the Hague Convention may be able to get them back. The effectiveness of this law is
                                                limited because it only applies when countries are signatories, and not all nations signed on for their own protection needs or lack thereof, depending upon how you look at things personally. Still, 
                                                either way, there's no easy way around getting an individual who goes missing filed with local authorities, so let us hope that someone else knows more than we do!
                                                      <br><br>
                                                   The child abduction laws of the Hague Convention do not allow for modifications but state that any kids who have been abducted should be returned to their home country.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                   This is not easy to do, but there are ways. The parent needs evidence, and proof that their child has been taken abroad without permission by an abductor
                                                   or transporter who signs up under the terms of this treaty-which only applies if both countries sign onto it as well!

                                            The limited defenses available under the Hague Convention to a claim that your child was wrongfully removed, but they're not enough. Some of the most common reasons that parents want to remove their children from another 
                                            country are because they believe it will be in favor for them, or the parent doesn't like where they live. Other 
                                            times people feel like moving on with life and looking forward. In contrast, memories attached holding back progress, such as pain from a past relationship, could make returning difficult.

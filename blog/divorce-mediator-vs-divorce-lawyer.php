                                        Divorce Mediator Vs. Divorce Lawyer – What To Choose? </h3>


                                    <div class="my-texttt">
                                        <div class="text">No matter what your circumstances are and in which state you
                                            live, the decision to get a divorce is stressful and tough. Not only the
                                            decision to divorce is challenging, choosing a mediator vs. divorce lawyer
                                            makes it more difficult.
                                            Many individuals don't want to hire a lawyer to cut the expense of divorce –
                                            however, mediators also fail to reach an agreement in some divorce cases.
                                            This comparison doesn't mean that lawyers and mediators work in opposition.
                                            In fact, some divorce cases require a lawyer and a mediator too!
                                            A mediator is a neutral person who focuses on the best interest and mutual
                                            agreement between both parties; however, a divorce lawyer only emphasizes
                                            the clients' best interest.
                                            So, which is better – a divorce attorney or a mediator?
                                            Hold on! Before reaching the conclusion of choosing a divorce lawyer or a
                                            divorce mediator – it is important to learn about the differences between
                                            each and the outcome they can have on your divorce.

                                        <div class="text">It is the traditional type of divorce where couples walk to
                                            the court for a divorce. One party files a petition to terminate the
                                            marriage and decide about child custody and property division. Both parties
                                            hire their divorce attorney who will specifically represent and focus on the
                                            best interest of their client.
                                            Your divorce lawyer will represent you during each proceeding without
                                            concerning about the best interest of your spouse. A lawyer is beneficial

                                            suggest it to your partner. On the contrary, if you think mediation isn’t
                                            for you, it will be best to hire a family law attorney to present your case

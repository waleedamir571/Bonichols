                                            public, it is an important profession for society as well as the justice
                                            system. The general public has mocked and seen it as an evil occupation.
                                            This profession is based on the idea that the public is being exploited by
                                            lawyers who
                                            charge huge fees and have the goal of winning the case. However, this day is
                                            about spreading the awareness that many of these myths exist and that not
                                            all lawyers practice law with ethics.</div>

                                            decision to divorce is challenging, choosing a mediator vs. divorce lawyer
                                            makes it more difficult.
                                            Many individuals don't want to hire a lawyer to cut the expense of divorce –
                                            however, mediators also fail to reach an agreement in some divorce cases.
                                            This comparison doesn't mean that lawyers and mediators work in opposition.
                                            In fact, some divorce cases require a lawyer and a mediator too!
                                            A mediator is a neutral person who focuses on the best interest and mutual
                                            agreement between both parties; however, a divorce lawyer only emphasizes
                                            the clients' best interest.
                                            So, which is better – a divorce attorney or a mediator?
                                            Hold on! Before reaching the conclusion of choosing a divorce lawyer or a
                                            divorce mediator – it is important to learn about the differences between
                                            each and the outcome they can have on your divorce.

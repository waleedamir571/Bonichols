								looking for. His guidance throughout the process was well articulated and there is no

								well and there is no question in my mind who I will go to for future support if needed.

							<div class="text">I had the privilege of working with Bo and his team for my family law
								case, and I cannot express enough how grateful I am for the outstanding legal
								representation I received. Bo is more than just a lawyer; he's a compassionate and
								dedicated advocates who truly cares about their clients.
								Bo took the time to listen to my concerns, providing reassurance and expert guidance
								every step of the way. Bo's knowledge of family law is unparalleled, and they ensured
								that I was well-informed about the legal process and potential outcomes.
								What sets Bo and his team apart is their unwavering commitment to achieving the best
								possible results for their clients. They are a fierce and strategic litigator in the
								courtroom, fighting tirelessly for my rights and interests. I felt confident and
								supported throughout the entire process, knowing that I had a true advocate on my side.
								Beyond their legal prowess, Bo exhibited exceptional communication skills. They promptly
								responded to my emails and calls, keeping me updated on the progress of my case. This
								level of accessibility and transparency made a challenging time in my life much more
								manageable.
								Additionally, Bo showed remarkable empathy and sensitivity to the emotional toll that
								family law matters can take on individuals and families. He provided emotional support
								when I over worried, which was just as important to me as their legal expertise.
								I am pleased to say that with Bo as my attorney, we achieved a favorable outcome in my
								family law case. His attention to detail, thorough preparation, and dedication to my
								case were evident throughout.
								If you are in need of a family law attorney who is not only highly skilled but also
								genuinely cares about their clients' well-being, I wholeheartedly recommend Bo's and his
								team. They are the embodiment of what a family law attorney should be: compassionate,
								knowledgeable, and a relentless advocate for justice.
								I cannot thank Bo enough for the exceptional legal representation and support they
								provided. They truly are a beacon of hope in the world of family law, and I am forever
								grateful for their guidance and expertise.
								Thank you!</div>

							<div class="text">Bo was my second lawyer. I ended up at his office after my prior attorney
								gave me bad advice at
								our temporary orders mediation and I had an uphill climb to come back from it. Bo will
								tell you straight, he really challenged my thinking and my ideas.
								I think I really grew as a person, from a stay at home mom with a very scared and
								controlled mindset. It has been great for my case and my self esteem.
								He is not cheap but I knew I wanted a litigator who would go to court (I'm also an
								attorney). Divorce is hard and petty. I was a mess and he was calm and planned
								long-term.
								I ended up with the custody and child support arrangement I wanted for the most part,
								without having to go to trial. Yes, Bo is expensive. He is worth it though.

								As an attorney I have been shocked at how poor many other attorneys out there are and/or
								the unethical tactics used. He works the case and does what is needed.
								He took me seriously which was so important to me. I knew I didn't want to totally
								destroy my ex as was suggested by several lawyers. Bo is a good mix of caring and tough,
								and I am very pleased with the great outcome he got for me coming from behind as I was.

								case I was presenting had no chance. In my initial telephone conversation with Bo, I
								could see that he was asking a few questions that none of the other lawyers asked. He
								dug a little deeper and truly understood the dynamics of a very unjust settlement ruling
								that had been issued. Bo was able to correct the unbelievably poor efforts made by the
								previous attorneys by having the original sloppy divorce decree virtually re-written. He
								then presented a compelling case which clearly spelled out the neglect and unjust
								previous ruling. That resulted in the opposing party agreeing to a more just settlement.
								Bo accomplished what every other lawyer said could not be done. Throughout the entire
								litigation, Bo was extremely prompt in responding to phone calls, text or emails. Bo
								would respond, (not an assistant) many times within hours or on the same day. If you
								need a lawyer to do the impossible...Hire Bo!!!</div>

							<div class="text">Let me start by saying I rarely write reviews, and in submitting this
								review I’m also exposing myself to judgment for a few bad choices I’ve made. But I feel
								strongly enough about the representation I received from Bo Nichols to happily share my
								story. To my dismay, I am a repeat client of Bo Nichols. In 2010, Bo helped me with a
								very ugly, contentious child custody modification. I was not very well represented (by
								another attorney) during my first divorce and felt pressured to agree to terms which
								were not in the best interest of my children. With Bo's assistance, the situation was
								corrected and my kids and I got our lives back. Bo knew I was considering remarriage and
								despite his counsel to me in 2010, I failed to draft a pre-nuptial agreement before my
								second marriage. Hence, seven years later, in 2017, I found myself facing divorce #2 and
								I once again turned to Bo for assistance. Thank God there were no children from the
								marriage, but this time I was faced with fighting for everything I have worked so hard
								to provide for myself and my children. It was especially difficult for me because I am a
								woman with a successful career and 4 children to put through college. Bo helped me to
								put things in perspective, paint a vivid picture of my situation for the mediator, and
								ultimately resolve the matter to my advantage. Bo has tremendous knowledge of the law
								and the Texas court system. He fights for his clients with confidence, persistence, and
								edge. He is a no-nonsense type of attorney who is not afraid to go head to head with
								opposing counsel and take the fight to the court room, if necessary. However he also has
								a compassionate side. Bo was always there to help calm my fears and reassure me that
								everything would be ok. While I wouldn’t wish my situation on anyone, there is no
								attorney I’d rather have on my side than Bo Nichols.</div>

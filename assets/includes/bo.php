						<div class="text">John “Bo” Nichols, or “Bo” as his friends call him, is a 3rd generation Houstonian and loves the city and the relationships he has created here. In fact, he loves it so much, that he came back home to finish his undergraduate work at the University of Houston.<br><br>Bo is a people person and he truly does love most people and gives them the benefit of the doubt, always seeing the good in everyone. He has carried this mentality over into his practice with his clients by entering into each attorney/client relationship with a sense of optimism. He knows that his clients are good people, who might not always be on their best behavior due to circumstances beyond their control, such as the stress of divorce. And, he understands that stress very well, having gone through his own divorce with children involved.</div>

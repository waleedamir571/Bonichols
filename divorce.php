											<div class="text">I recently had the unfortunate experience of being
												unexpectedly served with legal papers, marking one of the most difficult
												days I’ve faced. The year 2024 has proven to be the most challenging for
												me so far, and I’m incredibly grateful to have had Bo and his
												exceptional team, Amber and Taylor, by my side through it all.
												From the very first moment I contacted Bo, I knew I was in capable
												hands. Bo’s expertise and calm demeanor helped to alleviate my initial
												shock and anxiety. He was incredibly thorough in explaining the legal
												process, ensuring that I fully understood every step along the way. His
												ability to navigate complex legal matters with confidence and clarity
												was truly impressive.
												Amber and Taylor were equally remarkable, consistently providing a
												world-class client experience. They were always available to answer my
												questions, no matter how trivial, and made sure I felt supported
												throughout the entire ordeal. Their professionalism, coupled with their
												genuine care and concern for my well-being, made a significant
												difference during this trying time.
												What stands out the most is the personal touch that Bo and his team
												bring to their work. Despite the challenges, they made me feel like I
												wasn’t just another client but someone they truly cared about helping.
												Their dedication, compassion, and commitment to achieving the best
												possible outcome for me were evident in everything they did.
												I can’t thank Bo, Amber, and Taylor enough for their outstanding support
												during one of the most stressful periods of my life. When you’re looking
												for a family attorney who is not only highly skilled but also genuinely
												cares about their clients, look no further. Bo and his team are simply
												the best.”</div>

											<div class="text">Bo was my second lawyer. I ended up at his office after my

												I had an

												challenged my thinking and my ideas. I think I really grew as a person,
												from a stay at home mom with a very scared and controlled mindset. It
												has been great for my case and my self esteem. He is not cheap but I
												knew I
												wanted a litigator who would go to court (I'm also an attorney). Divorce
												is hard and petty. I was a mess and he was calm and planned long-term.
												I ended up with the custody and child support arrangement I wanted for
												the most part, without having to go to trial. Yes, Bo is expensive.
												He is worth it though. As an attorney I have been shocked at how poor
												many other attorneys out there are and/or the unethical tactics used.
												He works the case and does what is needed. He took me seriously which
												was so important to me. I knew I didn't want to totally destroy my ex
												as was suggested by several lawyers. Bo is a good mix of caring and
												tough, and I am very pleased with the great outcome he got for me coming
												from behind as I was.</div>

												forward thinker and was prepared for situations and negotiations that I
												otherwise would not have prevailed from. He protected me when things
												were less than cordial and championed me as his client both publicly and
												in private. As difficult as the process was, John Bo was able to lead me
												through it with his calm but commanding demeanor. He is incredibly
												intuitive and could tell when I was nervous or scared. In that moment,
												without skipping a beat, he was able to lighten to mood and help me
												breathe easier. No matter the obstacle put in our path, his focus was
												always on the most beneficial outcome and he was able to hold steadfast
												in our route to get there. He’s lucky to have Annette on his
												professional staff as she was able to quickly work her magic executing
												things to keep our preparation organized and productive. I’m convinced I
												could not have navigated with process without him or with any other
												attorney. I feel incredibly fortunate to have met John Bo and strongly

											<div class="text">Ok, so here is the sad truth, I am a repeat customer.
												I believe in marriage and do it often. And Bo has been my counsel
												throughout these years. Bo has helped me through a
												divorce and then a pre-nup and follow-up work with my ex-wife. As a
												professional person, I can relate to
												the main questions you want answers to: Is he competent? He is at the
												top of his tier both in legal
												knowledge and familiarity with the local attorneys and judges. He is
												also a great counselor at a
												time where both parties are not thinking straight. This part is vital
												and often not rated.
												Bo is a master of getting you to a safe shore with the best possible
												outcome for you and more important,
												your reputation and your childrens needs. Is he worth the cost? yes.
												While great attorneys and doctors may
												seem expensive, they are a great investment as the results of making a
												mistake are devastating.
												Bo is a consummate and honest artist of his craft. He also does not
												inflate the costs or churn
												( a favorite of some of the ilk).
												So all in all you will pay for what you get - a serious pro on at your
												side to navigate the tough waters of divorce.</div>

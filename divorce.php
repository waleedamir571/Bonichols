				<p class="text text-center">Divorce is one of the most stressful things that a person must deal with. Divorce is like a death without the option of having a burial and a memorial service, and if you have children with your spouse, then you still have to find a way to co-parent and get along with that person for what could be years. It’s not easy, and at Bo Nichols Law, we know it’s not easy because we have been in your shoes.</p>
				<p class="text text-center">Most divorces are contested. This means that there are issues that will need to be worked out by a third party, which can be a judge, a mediator or an attorney. If your divorce is uncontested, both parties are in full agreement of the divorce and the division of property and it is simply a matter of filing paperwork and waiting the required amount of days before you can visit the judge to make it final.</p>

                <p class="text-high red-clr">What happens when a divorce is contested?</p>
			    <p class="text text-white">The first thing you need to do is look at your options and hire an attorney. Interviewing attorneys to find the right fit for you is imperative, because you will need to be able to trust your attorney and you will also be spending a lot of time with them. They will be your confidante and your support system during this very trying and potentially long process.</p>
			    <p class="text text-white">It’s important that your attorney knows the current Texas laws and Family Code and is admitted to practice in all Harris County Courthouses. Check into their background and be sure you are comfortable with your decision before hiring them.</p>
			    <p class="text text-white">Your attorney will know to ask the right questions, file the right paperwork and take the right depositions. The interrogatories will be asked for in a timely manner and your attorney will not inundate the other attorney with unnecessary emails and phone calls as to drive up your bill. They will be on your side always.</p>
			    <p class="text text-white">Your attorney will be able to explain the Texas Family Code regarding Child Support and Visitation and Custody to you in a very clear manner so you understand it and won’t get frustrated with you when you have questions.</p>
			    <p class="text text-white">Your attorney will know how to protect your assets by filing discovery and temporary restraining orders or injunctions to prevent transfer or “hiding” of assets and possible harassment.</p>
			    <p class="text text-white">Your attorney will make sure there are temporary orders in place to determine such things as who stays in the home during divorce proceedings, living arrangements for children involved and who pays the bills during this time.</p>
			    <p class="text text-white">Your attorney will advocate for you, whether it is in mediation or in the courtroom.</p>
			    <p class="text text-white">Bo Nichols Law is that law firm that will fight for you during your divorce and after your divorce if any issues arise.

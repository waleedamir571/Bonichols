                    <p class="text-center text">This includes paying child support. In the state of Texas, Texas Family
                        Code has guideline percentages which apply to the first $9,200.00 of the non-custodial parent’s
                        monthly net resources. If the child has proven special needs, then additional support may be
                        warranted. The non-custodial parent is the parent that the child does not reside with most of
                        the time. Even though these laws are in place, the Judge, at their discretion can give more or
                        less than the guidelines of child support.
                        It’s important to understand what you are entitled to when it comes to child support and what
                        child support means.
                        A professional child support attorney in Houston can help you modify the order or get the
                        appropriate child support. </p>

                    <p class="text-center text">When you have children, it is your obligation to financially care for
                        those children when

                        believe in child support. We also believe that the custodial parent should not expect
                        to be able to live off the child support they are given by the court. With us, you will have the
                        assistance of a child support lawyer in Houston who will help ensure the best
                        possible outcome for you and your child.
                        We will fight for your children, because we believe the children should not suffer because of
                        the decisions of the parents. </p>

                                        Child support laws in Texas provide these guideline calculations to non-resident
                                        parents: 20% of the net monthly income is paid to support a single child and 5%
                                        is added for each additional child. If the net monthly income of the obligor is
                                        more than $7500, the court applies the same calculation to the amount above
                                        $7500. Remember, these are guidelines and if the obligee can prove that the
                                        child needs more support due to special needs, the court can order the
                                        non-resident to pay more.

							<div class="text-li">John “Bo” Nichols, or “Bo” as his friends call him, is a 3rd generation
								Houstonian and loves the city and the relationships he has created here. In fact, he
								loves it so much, that he came back home to finish his undergraduate work at the
								University of Houston.<br>Bo is a people person and he truly does love most people
								and gives them the benefit of the doubt, always seeing the good in everyone. He has
								carried this mentality over into his practice with his clients by entering into each
								attorney/client relationship with a sense of optimism. He knows that his clients are
								good people, who might not always be on their best behavior due to circumstances beyond
								their control, such as the stress of divorce. And, he understands that stress very well,
								having gone through his own divorce with children involved.
								<br>
								It is because of this that Bo Nichols is able to feel for and
								understand each of his clients. He knows how hard it is (as a client) to identify with
								and
								follow the advice of some person who claims to have your best interest at heart.
